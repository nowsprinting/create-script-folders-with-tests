This Unity editor extension creates script folders (Editor, Runtime, and each Tests) containing assembly definition files (.asmdef).


## Features

When opening the context menu and selecting
**Create > C# Script Folders and Assemblies with Tests**
, The root folder (e.g., named **YourFeature**) and below will be created as follows.

### Creating folders and asmdefs

#### Using under Assets folder

```
Assets
└── YourFeature
   ├── Scripts
   │   ├── Editor
   │   │   └── YourFeature.Editor.asmdef
   │   └── Runtime
   │       └── YourFeature.asmdef
   └── Tests
       ├── Editor
       │   └── YourFeature.Editor.Tests.asmdef
       └── Runtime
           └── YourFeature.Tests.asmdef
```

#### Using under Packages folder

```
Packages
└── your.package.name
   └── YourFeature
      ├── Editor
      │   └── YourFeature.Editor.asmdef
      ├── Runtime
      │   └── YourFeature.asmdef
      └── Tests
          ├── Editor
          │   └── YourFeature.Editor.Tests.asmdef
          └── Runtime
              └── YourFeature.Tests.asmdef
```

Package folder (e.g., named **your.package.name**) must be created before.
Because you can not open the context menu directly under the Packages folder.

After creating folders, move the Editor, Runtime, and Tests folders directly under the **your.package.name** folder.
And remove the **YourFeature** folder.
Then it will be the same as the official [package layout](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html).

```
Packages
└── your.package.name
   ├── Editor
   │   └── YourFeature.Editor.asmdef
   ├── Runtime
   │   └── YourFeature.asmdef
   └── Tests
       ├── Editor
       │   └── YourFeature.Editor.Tests.asmdef
       └── Runtime
           └── YourFeature.Tests.asmdef
```

> **Warning**  
> Move folders using JetBrains Rider.
> Because to update DotSettings files (see below).


### Assembly Definition References in asmdefs

"Assembly Definition References" in each asmdef are set as follows.

- `YourFeature.Editor` has references to `YourFeature`
- `YourFeature` has no references
- `YourFeature.Tests` has references to `YourFeature`
- `YourFeature.Editor.Tests` has references to `YourFeature` and `YourFeature.Editor`


### Creating DotSettings files

And creating .csproj.DotSettings file for each assembly.
This file is set up to make the [Namespace does not correspond to file location](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/CheckNamespace.html) inspection work as expected in JetBrains Rider.
Do not forget to commit .DotSettings files for that project.

Specifically, disabled the [Namespace provider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Refactorings__Adjust_Namespaces.html) for the following folders.

- Scripts
- Scripts/Runtime
- Tests
- Tests/Runtime

This will result in the expected namespace per folder as follows.

- Scripts/Editor: YourFeature.Editor
- Scripts/Runtime: YourFeature
- Tests/Editor: YourFeature.Editor
- Tests/Runtime: YourFeature

> **Warning**  
> Under Packages namespace resolution works with Unity 2020.2 or later.
> Because to use the Root Namespace property of asmdef.
