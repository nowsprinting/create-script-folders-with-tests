[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.nowsprinting.create-script-folders-with-tests?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.nowsprinting.create-script-folders-with-tests/)

This Unity Editor Extensions create script folders (Editor, Runtime, and each Tests) containing assembly definition file (.asmdef).

When opening the context menu and select **Create | C# Script Folders and Assemblies with Tests**,
The root folder (e.g., named "MyFeature") and below will be created as follows.

```
MyFeature
├── Scripts
│   ├── Editor
│   │   └── MyFeature.Editor.asmdef
│   └── Runtime
│       └── MyFeature.asmdef
└── Tests
    ├── Editor
    │   └── MyFeature.Editor.Tests.asmdef
    └── Runtime
        └── MyFeature.Tests.asmdef
```

And the references of each asmdef are set as follows.

- `MyFeature` has not references
- `MyFeature.Editor` has references to `MyFeature`
- `MyFeature.Tests` has references to `MyFeature`
- `MyFeature.Editor.Tests` has references to `MyFeature` and `MyFeature.Editor`
